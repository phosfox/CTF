[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       [1mSocat[0m  is  a  command  line based utility that establishes two bidirec-[m
       tional byte streams  and  transfers  data  between  them.  Because  the[m
       streams  can be constructed from a large set of different types of data[m
       sinks and sources (see address types),  and  because  lots  of  address[m
       options  may be applied to the streams, socat can be used for many dif-[m
       ferent purposes.[m
[m
       [1mFilan[0m is a utility  that  prints  information  about  its  active  file[m
       descriptors  to  stdout.  It  has been written for debugging [1msocat[0m, but[m
       might be useful for other purposes too. Use the -h option to find  more[m
